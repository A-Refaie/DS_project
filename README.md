## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The motivation for this project is to identify important risk factor for heart disease through simple data analysis techniques. The analysis will allow us to answer some questions such as:

1. Does heart disease signifcantly impact physical and mental health? 
2. What are the most prominent indicators of heart disease?
3. What are the notable differences in life style and behaviour between heart disease patients and healthy individuals?
4. Are males more likely to have heart disease than females?

The original dataset was released by CDC and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The file contains two notebooks (one for data processing and one for data analysis). In addition to that, a csv file is available containing the clean version of the dataset.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The results of the analysis was published as blog post on medium and can be found [here](https://medium.com/@refa3e1994/heart-disease-and-its-main-life-style-indicators-1730eaf8532f). The results of the analysis can be summerized as follows:

- Heart disease has a significant effect on individuals general health which shows as physical and mental fatigue. 
- The most common indicator of heart disease are: low income, being a former smoker, and divorced or single individuals.
- There are no significant differtence between males and females regarding the possibility of having heart disease.
